                            Not everyone understands that after the start of work, interaction with the team cannot be
                            interrupted.
                            If the client has a built-in architecture, code requirements,
                            then connect the developer (give access to accounts and layouts) and leave him to figure it
                            out,
                            nothing good will come of it.

                            The client must be willing to extend their onboarding system to outside professionals as
                            well as to the in-house team.
                            Discuss your vision, requirements for approaches, expectations for results.
                            Giving regular feedback is the minimum without which a high-quality result will not work.

                            Keep the promises you made to the developers - treat them in this matter the same way you
                            treat your employees.
                            Everything you say in an interview should not be at odds with reality.
                            For example, if you need to work with large amounts of legacy code, written three years ago.
                            Do not hesitate to say it directly - developers also work with such tasks, but they should
                            understand what awaits them.

                            Don't be afraid to give outstaffers more freedom and more serious tasks.
                            Maintain a balance between refactoring and feature development,
                            which will allow the developer to get better.
                            Work that will be shelved also does not motivate anyone.
                            If you worked on a feature that did not go into production,
                            it is offensive and demotivating - even if the job has been paid.

                            about the project.
                            Long and consistent work with flat performance is better than bursts of productivity
                            interspersed with failures in performance,

                            It is important to talk to the developer, and not slip into the bureaucracy. Otherwise, the
                            employee may get the impression
                            that he was caught in a hostile environment.
                            All this applies to outstaffers, because they are the same team members.

                            The reality is that today's outstaffer can become your full-time employee in a year or two
                            (even if you don't expect it at all),
                            and you should immediately treat him as your employee.
                            It is also important to understand that an outstaffer who has left the company with a
                            negative feeling talks about it everywhere,
                            forming the customer's company reputation. How will you then prove that it was precisely
                            because it was an outstaffer?
                            And, most likely, it will only get worse.
