                            <span class="fw-bold">Java</span> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
                            language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
                            It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run
                            anywhere (WORA),
                            meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need
                            for recompilation.
                            Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual
                            machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
                            The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either
                            of them.
                            The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code
                            modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
                            As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
                            GitHub, particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million
                            developers.

                            Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been
                            acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java
                            platform.
                            The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class
                            libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses.
                            As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had
                            relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license.
                            Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference
                            implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most
                            developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

                            Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popular

                            <span class="fw-bold">Jakarta Server Pages</span> (JSP; formerly JavaServer Pages) is a
                            collection of technologies that helps software developers create dynamically generated web
                            pages based on HTML, XML, SOAP,
                            or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP and
                            ASP, but uses the Java programming language.
                        </p>
                        <p class="block-p-color mb-4 lh-base fw-light fs-4">
                            To deploy and run Jakarta Server Pages, a compatible web server with a servlet container,
                            such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, is required.
                            Architecturally, JSP may be viewed as a high-level abstraction of Java servlets. JSPs are
                            translated into servlets at runtime, therefore JSP is a Servlet;
                            each JSP servlet is cached and re-used until the original JSP is modified.
                        </p>
                        <p class="block-p-color mb-4 lh-base fw-light fs-4">
                            Jakarta Server Pages can be used independently or as the view component of a server-side
                            modelâ€“viewâ€“controller design, normally with JavaBeans as the model and Java servlets
                            (or a framework such as Apache Struts) as the controller. This is a type of Model 2
                            architecture.
                        </p>
                        <p class="block-p-color mb-4 lh-base fw-light fs-4">
                            JSP allows Java code and certain predefined actions to be interleaved with static web markup
                            content, such as HTML.
                            The resulting page is compiled and executed on the server to deliver a document. The
                            compiled pages, as well as any dependent Java libraries, contain Java bytecode rather than
                            machine code.
                            Like any other .jar or Java program, code must be executed within a Java virtual machine
                            (JVM) that interacts with the server's host operating system to provide an abstract,
                            platform-neutral environment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="block-p-color mb-4 lh-base fw-light fs-4">
                            JSPs are usually used to deliver HTML and XML documents, but through the use of
                            OutputStream, they can deliver other types of data as well.
                            The Web container creates JSP implicit objects like request, response, session, application,
                            config, page, pageContext, out and exception. JSP Engine creates these objects during
                            translation phase.

                            mapping tool for the Java programming language.
                            It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational
                            database. Hibernate handles objectâ€“relational impedance mismatch problems by replacing
                            direct,
                            persistent database accesses with high-level object handling functions.

                            Hibernate's primary feature is mapping from Java classes to database tables, and mapping
                            from Java data types to SQL data types.
                            Hibernate also provides data query and retrieval facilities. It generates SQL calls and
                            relieves the developer from the manual handling and object conversion of the result set.

                            <span class="fw-bold">Jakarta Messaging API</span> (formerly Java Message Service or JMS
                            API) is a Java application programming interface (API) for message-oriented middleware.
                            It provides generic messaging models, able to handle the producerâ€“consumer problem, that can
                            be used to facilitate the sending and receiving of messages between software systems.
                            Jakarta Messaging is a part of Jakarta EE and was originally defined by a specification
                            developed at Sun Microsystems before being guided by the Java Community Process.
