                            <span class="fw-bold">Android</span> is a mobile operating system based on a modified
                            version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for
                            touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
                            Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and
                            commercially sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first
                            commercial Android device,
                            the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008.

                            It is free and open-source software; its source code is known as Android Open Source Project
                            (AOSP), which is primarily licensed under the Apache License.
                            However, most Android devices ship with additional proprietary software pre-installed, most
                            notably Google Mobile Services (GMS) which includes core apps such as Google Chrome,
                            the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services
                            development platform.

                            Over 70 percent of Android smartphones run Google's ecosystem; some with vendor-customized
                            user interface and software suite, such as TouchWiz and later One UI by Samsung,
                            and HTC Sense. Competing Android ecosystems and forks include Fire OS (developed by Amazon)
                            or LineageOS.
                            However, the "Android" name and logo are trademarks of Google which impose standards to
                            restrict "uncertified" devices outside their ecosystem to use Android branding.

                            The source code has been used to develop variants of Android on a range of other
                            electronics, such as game consoles, digital cameras, portable media players,
                            PCs and others, each with a specialized user interface. Some well known derivatives include
                            Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables, both developed by Google.

                            <span class="fw-bold">Kotlin</span> is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose
                            programming language with type inference.
                            Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard
                            library depends on the Java Class Library,
                            but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but
                            also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code
                            (via LLVM);
                            e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps. Language development
                            costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.

                            On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred
                            language for Android app developers. Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October
                            2017,
                            Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin
                            compiler produces Java 8 bytecode by default (which runs in any later JVM), but lets the
                            programmer
                            choose to target Java 9 up to 16, for optimization, or allows for more features; has
                            bidirectional record class interoperability support for JVM, introduced in Java 16,
                            considered stable as of Kotlin 1.5.

                            until the name iPadOS was introduced with version 13 in 2019. It is the world's second-most
                            widely installed mobile operating system, after Android. It is the basis
                            for three other operating systems made by Apple: iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS. It is

                            <span class="fw-bold">Swift</span> is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled
                            programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community.
                            First released in 2014, Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier programming
                            language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s
                            and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch
                            frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to interoperate with the huge
                            body
                            of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It is
                            built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since
                            version 6,
                            released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library, which allows
                            C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.
                        </p>

                            Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably
                            dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming and similar features,
                            but in a "safer" way, making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features addressing
                            some common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar
                            to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an
                            extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and classes,
                            which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term "protocol-oriented
                            programming" (similar to traits).

                            It was introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and iOS with iPhone SDK 3.0. It allows data
                            organized by the relational entity–attribute model to be serialized into XML,
                            binary, or SQLite stores. The data can be manipulated using higher level objects

                            interfaces directly with SQLite, insulating the developer from the underlying SQL.
