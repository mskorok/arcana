                            <span class="fw-bold">PHP</span> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web
                            development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.
                            The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for
                            Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext
                            Preprocessor.

                            PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module,
                            a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.
                            On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type
                            of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an
                            HTTP response.
                            Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which
                            can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response.
                            Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as
                            standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.
                            PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.

                            the PHP License.
                            PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating
                            systems and platforms.

                            The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with
                            the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations
                            aimed to follow.
                            Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.

                            WordPress was originally created as a blog-publishing system but has evolved to support

                            media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems (LMS) and online stores.
                            WordPress is used by 42.8% of the top 10 million websites as of October 2021,
                            WordPress is one of the most popular content management system solutions in use. WordPress
                            has also been used for other application domains, such as pervasive display systems (PDS).

                            Drupal provides a back-end framework for at least 13% of the top 10,000 websites worldwide –
                            ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political,
                            and government sites. Systems also use Drupal for knowledge management and for business
                            collaboration.

                            The Drupal community comprised more than 1.39 million members, including 121,000 users
                            actively contributing, resulting in more than 46,800 free modules that extend and customize
                            Drupal functionality,
                            over 2,900 free themes that change the look and feel of Drupal, and at least 1,300 free
                            distributions that allow users to quickly and easily set up a complex, use-specific Drupal
                            in fewer steps.

                            The standard release of Drupal, known as Drupal core, contains basic features common to
                            content-management systems. These include user account registration and maintenance, menu
                            management,
                            RSS feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. The Drupal core
                            installation can serve as a simple website, a single- or multi-user blog, an Internet forum,
                            or a community website providing for user-generated content.

                            Drupal also describes itself as a Web application framework. When compared with notable
                            frameworks, Drupal meets most of the generally accepted feature requirements for such web
                            frameworks.
                            Although Drupal offers a sophisticated API for developers, basic Web-site installation and
                            administration of the framework require no programming skills.
                            Drupal runs on any computing platform that supports both a web server capable of running PHP
                            and a database to store content and configuration.
